title: Strymon 0.1.0 Released
---

We are happy to announce the first open-source release of [Strymon](http://strymon.systems.ethz.ch/index.html), a novel system for online analytics, management, and simulations of large data centers.

Strymon is a large framework developed and maintained by a small [team](http://strymon.systems.ethz.ch/about.html) of researchers at the [ETH Zurich Systems group](https://www.systems.ethz.ch/).
This first release provides a sneak peek into what Strymon aims to become. We are planning to release more use-cases and core system components in future releases as they become stable.

This release contains:
- Strymon's core publish-subscribe mechanism.
- A CLI tool to start and stop Strymon, submit jobs, and check the system's status.
- An example use-case which generates a datacenter network topology and simulates switch and link failures.

Interested? [Download](/download) Strymon and follow the [getting-started guide](/docs/getting-started) to see the system in action.
If you have any questions or concerns, we are looking forward to your feedback at [strymon-users@lists.inf.ethz.ch](mailto:strymon-users@lists.inf.ethz.ch).
